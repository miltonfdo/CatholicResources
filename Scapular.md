#### History of the Scapular

Most often when we hear the word scapular, we think of a scapular in its most recognizable form, a small necklace of sorts constructed from two wool patches of cloth.  Scapulars, however, originated from the habit of monastic orders and started off as a work apron.  From this “apron” developed a special monastic garment to be worn by specific religious orders.  The scapular, in its original form, was often referred to as jugum Christi, or the yoke of Christ, and was even worn at bedtime.  A scapular worn in this way is a large piece of cloth that covers the individual from shoulder to shoulder and hangs down as far as the ankles, with an opening in the center for the head. 

During the early Middle Ages, the laity began to associate themselves with various monastic orders and formed Confraternities, secular oblates that would receive the scapular to wear upon death, as a sign of great honor.  Eventually, this tradition transformed into the small sacramental scapulars of today that are worn daily under or over regular clothing as an open sign of devotion.  The four oldest scapulars originated from four confraternities, the Carmelites, Servites, Trinitarians, and the Mercederians.  Today there are many more kinds of scapulars, and not all of them associated with a particular confraternity. 

The original and most common scapular is the Brown Scapular of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel. Given by Our Lady herself to the Carmelite friar, St. Simon Stock, with special promises to its wearers, the brown scapular is a sign of devotion and personal consecration to the Blessed Virgin Mary, placing oneself under her mantle of protection.





We wear scapulars because they were given to us by the Blessed Mother along with a promise.

These scapulars (a word meaning “shoulders” in Latin) are a sign of devotion to Mary and faithfulness to Christ. The original scapular was large piece of brown cloth worn over the shoulders of monks.

According to Catholic tradition, Our Lady gave the scapular to St. Simon Stock, the Father General of the Carmelite order, in the thirteenth century. Mary appeared to St. Simon in a vision, held out a scapular and said to him, ‘ . . . he who dies in this will not suffer eternal fire.’

Does this mean if you wear the scapular you get into heaven no matter what your actions? Of course not!

The scapular is not a “get out of hell free” card or a magical charm. It is an exterior sign of an interior fidelity to Christ and trust in his Mother’s love and intercession for her children.

Scapulars come in lots of different styles, but here’s what a basic one looks like.
In some ways it’s like a wedding ring. A husband and wife wear wedding rings to show their interior fidelity to each other. Similarly, when Catholics wear a scapular they are showing outwardly their love of Mary and commitment to Christ.

However, the scapular is more than just a sign. It is a Sacramental! Sacramentals are sacred signs that prepare us to receive grace and help us to be in a disposition to cooperate with that grace (CCC 1670).

Wearing a scapular can actually help prepare you to receive grace and therefore help you grow in holiness! Mary Our Mother gives us, her children, the gift of the scapular as both a sign and a tool for us to help us grow closer to her Son, which is always her desire.
