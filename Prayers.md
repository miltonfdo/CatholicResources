### 5 Most Powerful Prayers in History

1.) Our Father:
_Backgrond_: 
This is a very important Christian prayer, given to us by Jesus Christ Himself. It serves as an all occasion prayer that hits all the bases. It acknowledges God’s greatness, it invites God’s will, it petitions God for our needs and requests mercy as we pledge to forgive.

_Prayer_
Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

2.) Hail Mary:
_Backgrond_: 
This prayer is wonderful because it is dedicated to the Queen of Heaven, Mary, whose intercession is particularly powerful. This remarkably simple prayer has few elements, but all are taken from scripture. It praises Mary, and asks for her intercession. It is short, so it can be easily memorized and quickly spoken, and is the backbone of the devotion of the Rosary, which is easily the world’s most powerful devotion. With countless miracles and conversions to its credit, the Hail Mary is a powerful composition.
_Prayer_
Hail Mary full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death Amen.

3.) The Prayer of Jabez :
This is a life transformational prayer. It’s often overlooked because it is buried deep in an Old Testament genealogy and refers to a person who wrote no books. It was written down by Ezra, the author of 1 Chronicles. The prayer is a petition, requesting God for a blessing of abundance and protection.

Jabez called on the God of Israel. ‘If you truly bless me,’ he said, ‘you will extend my lands, your hand will be with me, you will keep harm away and my distress will cease.’ God granted him what he had requested (1 Chronicles 4:10).

4.) Jonah’s Prayer for Salvation:
We all face challenging moments in our lives. Jonah found himself in the belly of the leviathan, and from this place of utter despair and hopelessness, he cried for salvation. How often do we find ourselves already in the belly of the beast? Yet, even from this place we can cry out to the Lord and still He saves us! 3 Out of my distress I cried to Yahweh and he answered me, from the belly of Sheol I cried out; you heard my voice! 4 For you threw me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the floods closed round me. All your waves and billows passed over me;5 then I thought, ‘I am banished from your sight; how shall I ever see your holy Temple again?’6 The waters round me rose to my neck, the deep was closing round me, seaweed twining round my head.7 To the roots of the mountains, I sank into the underworld, and its bars closed round me forever. But you raised my life from the Pit, Yahweh my God! 8 When my soul was growing ever weaker, Yahweh, I remembered you, and my prayer reached you in your holy Temple.9 Some abandon their faithful love by worshipping false gods,10 but I shall sacrifice to you with songs of praise. The vow I have made I shall fulfil! Salvation comes from Yahweh! (Jonah 2:3-9).

5.) David’s Prayer for Deliverance:

Pursued by his own brother, David prayed for God to save him from his enemies. It seems most of us have enemies who out of a twisted sense of justice, or maybe out of evil, they seek to destroy us. Rather than seeking mercy and common accord, they believe they can only be satisfied with our downfall. When faced with such evil, we can ask God to guide and shield us. 1 Yahweh, how countless are my enemies, how countless those who rise up against me, 2 how countless those who say of me, ‘No salvation for him from his God! 3 But you, Yahweh, the shield at my side, my glory, you hold my head high. 4 I cry out to Yahweh; he answers from his holy mountain. 5 As for me, if I lie down and sleep, I shall awake, for Yahweh sustains me. 6 I have no fear of people in their thousands upon thousands, who range themselves against me wherever I turn. 7 Arise, Yahweh, rescue me, my God! You strike all my foes across the face, you break the teeth of the wicked. 8 In Yahweh is salvation, on your people, your blessing!
